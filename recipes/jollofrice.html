        <h4>DIRECTIONS</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken drumsticks in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add 1/2 onion, ginger, crushed bouillon cubes, garlic, 
                curry powder, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. 
                Mix well. Cook until chicken starts sticking to the bottom, about 5 minutes. Pour in water, mix, cover the pot, 
                and bring to a gentle simmer; cook for 15minutes. Remove from heat
            </li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish using a slotted spoon. Strain cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. Reserve 11/2 cups 
                liquid. Discard solids.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the middle and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. 
                An instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-low heat and cook 1/2 onion until soft and translucent but 
                not browned, about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce; cook and stir until slightly thickened and infuse into the oil, 5 to 7 minutes
            </li>
            <li>Stir reserved chicken broth, coconut milk, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, salt, and pepper into the pot. 
                Bring to a simmer; add rice. Cook, stirring often, until rice is almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add frozen 
                vegetables and continue cooking until rice is tender and creamy, about 5 minutes
            </li>
            <li>Heat 1/2 cup of canola oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. Add plantains and fry on both sides until 
                golden and cripsy, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Garnish jollof rice with fried plantains 
                and serve with chicken
            </li>
        </ol>
